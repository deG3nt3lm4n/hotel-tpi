Basically this is going to be a html and css website a **basic** site that will not have flex or grid implemented more so it will use floats to move around items
It will have 3 pages a homepage, about page, contact page.
The homepage is going to have a header w/nav + heroSection and footer with a nav menu with a little about section and features.
The about page will have an about section as well as testimonial section with a header w/ nav and footer
